# Data-Analyst
This repository documents my structured 3-month journey to become a Data Analyst. It contains study notes, practice exercises, SQL scripts, Power BI dashboards, Python notebooks, and end-to-end projects. The goal is to build strong foundations, gain hands-on skills, and create a portfolio that demonstrates real-world problem solving.
